Transformed a design template into a dynamic website, leveraging React JS, 
TailwindCSS, Chakra UI, and Swiper slider for an engaging front-end. Executed a robust
back-end with Express JS, Prisma, MongoDB, JWT, and Stripe, creating a seamless MERN
Authentication system. Users can explore and book tours, complete secure credit card
transactions, share travel experiences, and build profiles with a refined authentication
structure. Travel Makers offers ticket sales for both adults and children, with automated
email ticketing and admin functionalities for tour, user, comment, and ticket management.
